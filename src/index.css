@import "tailwindcss";

body {
    @apply bg-black text-white
}

/* The @apply rule is a Tailwind feature that allows us 
to use Tailwind classes in your CSS file. 
The bg-black class will change the background of the 
entire body to black, and the text-white will make
 all text white for better contrast. */
